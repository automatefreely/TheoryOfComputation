This program takes an e-nfa as input and a string and checks if the string is accepted by the e-nfa or not. The e-nfa is represented as a table with states as rows and symbols as columns. The first column is epsilon. The user is asked to enter the number of states and symbols. Then the user is asked to enter the number of transitions from each state on each symbol. Then the user is asked to enter the final states. Then the user is asked to enter a string. The program then prints the e-closure of each state. Then for each symbol in the string, the program takes the e-closure of the current state, then takes the transition on the symbol and then takes the e-closure of the resulting states. The program then prints the final states. If any of the final states belong to the set of final states, the string is accepted, else it is rejected.
